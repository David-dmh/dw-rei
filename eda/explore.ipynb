New carpet and paint throughout will give confidence you can move in today and update tomorrow, with a canvas to make this house - a family home.Greeted by a generous lounge as you enter the home through the front door, the privacy provided by the raised front garden is welcomed while providing a green outlook from inside. Separated by an attractive archway, the formal dining allows a sizeable separate space to entertain while still being inclusive if you would prefer. The large kitchen space, although original, is functional in design and opens onto a family meals area that flows to the outdoor covered pergola, offering entertaining capability that is sure to be appreciated. The three bedrooms and bathroom have smartly been separated from the living areas and generates a feel that this compact home is much larger than the floor area suggests. All bedrooms are equipped with built in robes and substantial windows, while the separate toilet and bathroom with a bathtub and shower provides the necessary amenities for a growing family. The separate laundry space is often lost in modern builds but the convenience of being able to use or close off this area and seamlessly access the backyard and clothesline, is a subtlety many are grateful for. The backyard is fully fenced and of a great proportion to accommodate kids and/or pets while soaking up the abundance of sun the northerly aspect provides. A double lock up carport is a great addition and provides easy access to the home, only a few steps for mum or dad and the groceries are safely being unpacked by the kids in the kitchen. Multiple schooling options are available in this location, with Taylor Primary and Namadgi P-6 the starting point before moving onto Namadgi 7-10. The Lazzari Bro’s is your local café for your morning coffee and if you don’t feel like driving four minutes to the large Woolworths at Kambah shopping precinct, you can stroll less than five minutes to the IGA just over your back fence.Although set to go to auction on March 26th, this property offers a great opportunity and will appeal to a range of buyers therefore having the potential to reach the owners realistic expectations prior to this date.

       "  'description': \"Question: Why should we own 38 Aspinall Street, Watson?It's rare to find a combination of luxury and a versatile floorplan without the complexity of restrictive body corporates.It's a separate title on a desirable 252 sqm parcel of land with a double-street frontage and laneway access onto Mabel Miller Lane while the front of the property faces Aspinall Street.The large open-plan living area and main bedroom face north.A combination of private courtyards, one for winter (front) and one for summer (rear), ensures endless entertainment options.The location is so convenient as it is just one right-hand turn onto Northbourne Avenue and only a few sets of lights until you hit Sydney.Saturday mornings can be spent at the farmers' market (10-minute walk). In the evenings, you can wine and dine your nights away in your private courtyard and finish the night off by catching a tram into town. There is also a bus stop right outside the front door for those who use public transport.If you secure ownership of 38 Aspinall Street, Watson, you'll be in the catchment area of two highly praised public schools: Majura Primary School and Lyneham High School.Most of the separate title terraces in this area are owner-occupied. Still, rental indicators are $900 in rent per week, with significant Airbnb income opportunity (hotelyourhome.com.au). Moreover, because it's not a body corp, you don't have to interfere with leasing rules and added costs.The owners have diligently updated the property, and there is nothing left to do other than enjoy.One of the striking features is the 6-meter-high grand entrance with modern 'halo' chandelier, and creature comforts like in-slab heating, continuous flow of hot water and fiber to the premises of up to 1,000 Mbps.It's well designed and ready for your ownership consideration. We hope to see you at an open house, which is essentially every Saturday and Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 10:15 a.m. Private inspections can be arranged during the week.Auction conditions-Offered with vacant possession on up to 60-calendar-day settlement terms-Early occupancy provided between exchange and settlement of nominal rent-Onsite auction on Saturday, March 19th, at 4 pm-$1000 deposit paid at auction with 10% at risk and 5% to be transferred within three working days if you are successful-For a fair and transparent process for all buyers, we are not entertaining pre-auction offers-Transfer is not restricted, and the land-lease scheme doesn't apply-The only unapproved structure is the rear pergola-Sales are rare here, and I hope to gather market feedback to provide an accurate guide regarding reasonable market value around campaign day 5-7. I will not offer a low price to attract you, only to raise it remarkably on auction day.Thank you for reading.

       "  'description': \"This lovely three bedroom home sits gracefully on a quiet tree-lined street at the high end of O'Connor, with north eastern views across roof and tree tops. With elegant lines, rich period character, warm timber and contrasting pops of colour, the home is artfully unique. Cedar doors at the rear of the open plan living space extend the home into the garden and the sweeping views.The facade of the house is a combo of raw brick and painted timber and its low form is typical of the modernist era. The front and rear glazing are so perfectly in balance you can see clean through the house to the established trees beyond. This clear sight line makes the house seem almost transparent – a feeling of floating, a lightness of being within the landscape. The front door opens onto an elegant foyer which creates a small junction between the living area and the hall that leads to the south and the three bedrooms, bathroom and toilet. Original hardwood floors run the length of the house and a high single line of book shelving beckons you to the bedrooms – each a gorgeous blush of different colour with leafy outlooks. The large master bedroom looks out to an Olive tree. The updated bathroom and separate toilet are perfectly preserved, thier 50s charm extending to the earthy, Italian, golden toned, round floor tiles.To the left of the foyer there is the large, open living, dining, kitchen which gives a felt experience of expansion and celebration as the lofty heights of the vaulted ceilings and vastness of over-sized glazings sweep your spirit up and out. The north east facing aspect of this cosy yet open space, graces the room with light. The original open fire with long timber mantle and vintage tiled detail is perfect for romantic winter evenings. This is a space to eat, share, celebrate, be, create and watch the weather and colours change with the seasons. The kitchen, tucked into the corner, with its sky blue counter tops contrasted with earthy artisan tiled splash back, evokes whimsy and delight.Cedar doors open out to a deck, with climbing potato and jasmine vines overlooking established sour cherry, fig and apple trees. Secluded yet elevated, there is plenty of room on the deck for entertaining and enjoying the views. A wonderfully preserved, iconic hills hoist graces one side of the garden.Relaxed yet curated – walls adorned with art, the hallway lined with books – this has been home to award winning poet, KA Nelson for many years. Her literary agent famously described this house as 'a warm hug'. She remembers raising the roof here, with book launches and poetry readings.Simple yet unabashedly special, 8 Quandong Street, extends its hand to you, as if it knows its own flare – daring you to align yourself with its robust simplicity and pared back qualities, to delight in its serenity – to live lightly within, yet removed, from the hustle and bustle of the nearby city. Quandong is a sought-after, leafy street close to O'Connor reserve and walking distance to the fabulous O'Connor and Lyneham shops.

NBN fibre-to-the-premises offers lightning-fast internet.  Beautiful new flooring and fresh paint throughout present a property that is ready for new owners to move into and enjoy or for investors to start generating income.The location is super-convenient, within sight of Palmerston District Primary School and opposite large, lush green sports fields.  With a bus stop right next door for easy trips to Gungahlin Town Centre and light rail access to the CBD, this property works with or without a car. Indeed, it is also just a short walk to the local Palmerston shops.  Gungahlin Drive is at the end of the street which means only 15 minutes driving to the CBD or 20 minutes to the airport.The smart investor seeks cashflow to build their portfolio and this block has amazing potential. It is versatile, with the house perfectly placed in the front corner for maximum access and open space. It is level and easily accessible with space for multiple vehicles (or vessels or other tools or toys) to set up as outdoor living area.  With the rental crisis in Canberra, the median rent has already risen to $680 per week. Before recently moving interstate and deciding to sell, the sellers had engaged Canberra Granny Flat Builders to draft a concept plan for a Secondary Residence so there are designs available to show the fantastic potential for this block.  Subject to development approval, an additional 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom property can be added for approx. $335,000 incl GST (rates and land tax stay the same even with all the extra rentable space).  Market rent for 59 Kosciuszko Avenue, Palmerston is already looking like $690-$720 per week and the anticipated rent for the secondary residence is $1000 per week, making this a potential cash cow.The foundation of my auctions is a fair-go for all buyers - auction terms:•\\tOnsite auction on Wednesday, 23 March 2022 at 6.00pm•\\tOffered with vacant possession on up to 60-calendar-day settlement terms•\\tEarly occupancy available between exchange and settlement at nominal rent•\\tDesign documents for the secondary dwelling are available but no guarantees are offered or provided by the seller•\\t$1000 deposit paid at auction with 10% at risk and 5% to be transferred within three working days if you are successful •\\tFor a fair and transparent process and access for all buyers, the sellers are not entertaining pre-auction offers•\\tThe transfer is not restricted, and the land-lease scheme doesn't apply•\\tInvestors can claim stamp duty on the purchase in the FY of exchange •\\tIt's hard to establish value my commitment is to provide fair and accurate market price feedback after about 7 days of marketing. See you there.  If you have any questions, please email me at: contact@auctionadvantage.com.au or call me on: 0400446605.  Frank Walmsley, Auction Advantage.\",\n",

We moved in late April 2018, so almost 4 years ago.\"\"I had a lovely villa in Forde, 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, two living areas and gorgeous Forde Pond frontage but I found we were not using all of that space and I would spend the weekend cleaning and gardening.\"\"I knew that I didn\\'t want to compromise on the great view, not downsize too much and for it to be a safe \\'lock up and walk away\\' when I travelled. When I saw Infinity Towers advertised, I went to \\'just to have a look\\' and walked out with Penthouse A! My views will never be built in, the floor plan is so practical and usable AND most importantly, there was a bath in the ensuite as well as the main bathroom.\"\"From my daughters\\' perspective, a walk-in robe, 25 metre pool, gym and walking distance to everything the town centre has to offer was a huge selling point.\"\"I can\\'t tell you how much I love it here. People are so friendly and helpful. We have a really strong and active residents Facebook Page and we look out for, and help each other. Not having lived in an apartment complex before I didn\\'t expect that. There are 5 Penthouses in the building and we are all friends. We celebrate birthdays, have BBQ\\'s and look after each other\\'s pets, feed each other through quarantine and offer advice on any projects we have going.\"\"My two favourite rooms would have to be my office; it makes me so happy.\"\"The second is the balcony. No matter how stressful the day, by the time I water the plants, feed the fish and spend a few minutes looking at the lights twinkling, my stress melts away.\"\"For personal reasons it is time for me to \\'go home\\' and move my primary residence outside of Canberra, which is the only reason I would leave this great community.\"\"They are the best neighbours you could ask for.\"More Details:• 2 Full bathrooms• 3 Spacious bedrooms, 2 with walk-in robes• 20 metre full building frontage balcony• New Bosch dishwasher• Upgraded Electrolux 900mm cooktop• Upgraded tapware in laundry and kitchen• Huge functional laundry room• Hand scraped bamboo flooring to main living areas• Safe pet enclosure on balcony• Double glazed windows• Burgmann Anglican School 0.9km• Gungahlin College 0.5km• Approx living area: 123sqm',\n",

The vergola is great allowing control over sun and shade, so it is always a very pleasant space all year round.  Yes, winter breakfasts on the deck too because the deciduous trees allow plenty of winter sun!The large main deck is great for large gatherings of family and friends, with easy inside/outside connection from the living areas.The house flows freely to the private and secure garden, with direct access from the main bedroom, the family meals area, and the formal living/dining area so there is always a sense of peace.  There is also plenty of birdlife to entertain us.  The magpies are particularly friendly.The 9-foot ceilings throughout this rare Fasham home, with vaulted ceilings and gable windows in the family areas and formal living area, give a wonderful sense of space and light.  The solar orientation is perfect, with sun and shade control to create the ideal living environment.Shara Place is a quiet cul-de-sac with friendly neighbours.

       "  'description': \"Enter through the shady Arbor and between the twin Olive trees that herald peace, behind you Mt Ainslie rising above the driveway. The considered front garden and restraint of the checkered pattern of pavers and mondo grasses, the silent street of quaint cottages – quintessential Ainslie. Inside a palpable sense of peace, the solid monocrete walls muting, hushing, you could be anywhere – in a world of your own creation. Think solace, immersion, privacy, beautiful energy and a sense of nostalgia for slow time, far from the bustle and pressure of modern life.The piper.home has a stillness, a sense of quiet consideration. Ray Barnett and Beatrice have lived and worked here for twenty years. Ray, an award winning artist, works quietly in his south facing studio, painting scenes from everyday life in soft watercolour, narrating his travel, observation and love of people and the world. From the moment you step up onto the side deck beneath the shade of the established grape vine you feel immersed in a world of your own. Diamonds of soft colours in the lead light panels of the front door greet you and inside high ceilings, bevelled glass to internal doors, timber sash windows, original cabinetry and each room – a different wash of gorgeous colour.  There are three lovely bedrooms, a renovated bathroom, large kitchen and enormous studio space or home office, which could become a gorgeous dining or second living space. A separate formal lounge featuring mid-century cabinetry – beautifully hand crafted by Ray with matching wooden pelmets are special features of this much loved, charming home. There is a sense of layerings of spaces and experiences – the deck hugging, wrapping around the home, french doors that open out from bedrooms extending the space and connecting you to the outside. The established garden, the raised vegetable beds – herbs, blueberries, a seed raising bed and worm farm and nearby garage and workshop. All thoughtful spaces making, sustaining, nourishing, engendering a connection to the essential, a call to create, imagine, relax and be.The established grape vine provides summer shading and winter light and with double glazing to the windows, insulation to the walls and flooring, 15 p.v. solar panels, solar hot water and four water tanks for the garden there is strong commitment to energy saving and sustainability. No air conditioning is required to keep the house cool while ducted gas warms the house in winter.That the piper.home is held within the gentle village of Ainslie further informs this feeling of other worldliness, eco awareness and a slow way of living.

This four bedroom, three bathroom home, has an effortlessly sophisticated aesthetic that combines with a clever layout to maximise privacy and connection. With attention to every detail – bespoke windows that frame trees or mountains, seasonal plantings for privacy, shade and light, ample storage, a dedicated children's wing, private self-contained guest accommodation and an upstairs escape for parents – the home has an incredible practical focus while oozing style and comfort. Private and enduring, this is an elegant home where family life unfolds alongside the vernacular of resort style living – think indoor/outdoor dining and weekends relaxing with friends by the plunge pool. The distinct modern facade – a combo of geometrical shapes, white on black and warm timber  – feels vibrant and sculptural. While inside the simplicity and cohesion of the interior palette  – crisp whites, soothing greys and golden oak with black accents – creates a felt experience of invitation and sanctuary.  Designed to contour to the elevated slope of the block, the home entices across various levels and intrigues from the moment you are welcomed through the oversized front door. A generous foyer draws your gaze to the wooden stairwell, with glass banister, floating within a light filled void. On your left there is a large open space that is set up as a playroom but could just as easily be a media or second living room. To the right you step up, and into, the open dining, kitchen, living with glass doors that expand the central kitchen to the outside. Low horizontal ribbon windows also frame the garden and flood the room with northern light.  The galley style kitchen with luxe details and inclusions – waterfall stone bench tops, SMEG appliances, honeycomb mosaic splash-back, ample storage including a walk-in pantry – is a central entertaining hub, accentuated by striking black pendant lights.  At the end of this long, open room you step down, into a cosy living area that is warm and secluded while still being open to the kitchen. The kitchen merges seamlessly with the outdoor dining room, complete with strip heating and ceiling fan, allowing the space to be enjoyed all year round. The plunge pool creates a breezy coolness in summer and the lovely combo of Japanese maples and crepe myrtle's softens and shades. The north-west orientation provides views to One Tree Hill and the setting sun in the evenings. The children's wing, tucked away at the end of the home, offers two light filled bedrooms, a separate family bathroom, with luxury free standing bath, and separate toilet.  Down another level and positioned privately, at the rear of the house, is a self-contained guest room, with walk-through robe, ensuite, and glass doors that open onto a courtyard.  The parents retreat fills the entire second floor, with a clever study nook and picture windows that capture views of the mountains. This large, elegant bedroom and sitting room, connects to a walk-in robe, ensuite with double vanities, and walk-in rain shower.

If have been looking to get off the rental roundabout, then this is the opportunity you don't want to miss.  So, what is it and how do you get it?  Firstly, this is a 1-bedroom top floor unit in a solid brick, older style project.  It has a separate laundry plus a separate bathroom with a WC, bath and separate shower recess.  The kitchen is tucked away to one side providing and open plan living and dining area with access to a north facing balcony.  A covered carport under the building and your own storage cage completes the picture along with security access to the stairwell, controlled from your unit.  It is a clean and liveable entry level unit that will allow you to pay off your own mortgage rather than your landlord's, and what is even better it will cost you less than it would in rent.  Give your landlord the flick and you can start being a homeowner.Located in the middle of the Woden Valley means it is only a 10-minute stroll to the local shops or to Woden.  And if you want to drive, the easy access to the Canberra road network means it is 15 minutes to the City, Russell and/or the Parliamentary Triangle.  The property has been rented for many years so, let's not be coy; it will need a bit of a tidy up and perhaps a repaint.  But you could live in the unit while you did all of this yourself.  If you want to take advantage of the opportunity, then call today to arrange an inspection.

This home has been updated and renovated, it offers good size living and dining, and it has a very pretty façade. 3 Biraban Place is a very liveable, comfortable home with a flexible floor plan as is, but it is crying out for improvement and the maximisation of ALL of its considerable potential.It is the ideal entry level home, particularly if you have in-house renovation skills and love a project!The real value here, is in the oodles of potential on offer.

Each residence is considered to invite natural light and to encourage a communal living space.  Not only does Cirrus aspire to integrate with the natural environment, but it also aims to provide a free flowing suite of private rooms for residents to enjoy.Cirrus is unique in that all residences have been designed to face north, offering breathtaking views of Lake Ginninderra and its lush surroundings. With the intention of creating seamless space, a generous balcony integrates with the main living area, where a choice of two neutral colour palettes harmonise with the abundant natural light.Open, airy kitchens include island bench tops wrapped in crisp white surfaces with timber grained joinery, undermount sinks and stainless steel European appliances. In certain apartments, the sensory experience of this communal space is enhanced by windows that are cantilevered over the side of the building, permitting residents to enjoy even wider cityscape views from the signature corner of the apartment.Inspired by hotel and resort amenities, Cirrus houses a ground floor of fine restaurants and commercial spaces for public enjoyment, a shared pool and gym floor that connects the two towers, and on-site parking for residents. The precinct is designed to open up onto the popular Emu Bank and its surrounding boulevards\\u200a\\u200athe entrance to a vibrant community.Each apartment at Cirrus will be meticulously crafted and finished with quality inclusions and all will have northerly water views.
